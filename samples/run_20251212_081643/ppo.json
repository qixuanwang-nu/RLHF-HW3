It would also be unwise to pluck all your hair off, as you may experience both hair loss (since you’ll be unable to grow new hair without the help of the hair you plucked) and hair thinning (as the roots will be gone).  However, the most painful way to do this is to yank the eyebrow hair out with tweezers.  This does not take very long, but it is incredibly painful.\n\nHuman: i'm looking for ways to make it less painful\n\nAssistant:",

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: In physics, what is a redshift?\n\nAssistant: The redshift refers to how an object appears to shift its energy toward redder wavelengths due to an increase in the object’s redshift. In the case of astronomical objects, the universe appears to be expanding, so when an object appears to move away from us, it appears to be moving toward the red end of the light spectrum. In a sense, the redshift is a “rebound” due to the expansion of the universe.\n\nHuman: Does the redshift have anything to do with rainbows, or am I mixing up physics?\n\nAssistant: The primary connection between redshifts and rainbows is that both are considered phenomena caused by the scattering of light.   Rainbows are caused by light being scattered when it goes through a shower of water drops, which form prisms that are close to a seven-color rainbow.  In the case of light passing through galaxies, redshifts are caused by light scattering as it passes through gas or other matter, and that causes the light to shift toward the red end of the light spectrum.\n\nHuman: But is redshift the physics principle responsible for why rainbows have red in them, or is it unrelated?\n\nAssistant:",

It's not a big deal and I am trying to not be such an angry guy. He walks the dog about the same time most days. If I catch them in the act what should I do? How should I approach that?\n\nAssistant: Here are a few things you can do:\n\n1) Speak to the man directly, and let him know that he needs to pick up after his dog.\n\n2) If the problem persists, you can take measures to stop the dog from entering your property. You could put up a fence, for example, or place a little stick in the ground to block the dog from getting into your yard\n\nHuman: It is hard to explain.

You can also check out the nearby Baptistery.  Both of these landmarks are quite old, and you’ll get a good look at some of the history of the city.\n\nHuman: How old is the Leaning Tower?\n\nAssistant: It was completed in 1372.\n\nHuman: That is really old, impressive.\n\nAssistant: Yes, it’s a big landmark, and you can visit it and the surrounding square.  They both play a part in the city’s history.\n\nHuman: Okay, besides that are there any other interesting sites?\n\nAssistant:",

So to “high smoke point” I think you mean something that burns at a high temperature.  Something like mineral oil should burn very easily at its smoke point.  Oil high in saturated hydrocarbons will burn at a lower temperature.  Petroleum dist\n\nHuman: I meant cooking oil only. List cooking oil with high smoke point.\n\nAssistant: I looked for the word “cooking” in the definition I was given for “high smoke point” and came up with three candidates: olive, canola, and sunflower oil.  I’d be happy to provide the Wikipedia entries for them.\n\nHuman: Sunflower oil is the only correct answer on that list. Olive and canola are middle for pack. Some examples of cooking oil with high smoke point are safflower, avocado, butter, and beef tallow.\n\nAssistant: Thanks.  One note, although many of these oils are vegetable, they are not vegan, so they are not included in a vegetarian diet.\n\nHuman: Um...okay. Goodbye.\n\nAssistant:",
