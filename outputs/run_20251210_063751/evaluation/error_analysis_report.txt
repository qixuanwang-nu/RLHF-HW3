I'd love to talk with you about this. As someone who has always had two eyes, it's hard to know how to help someone feel better when they're going through something that's likely pretty painful and hard to talk about.

[REJECTED RESPONSE] (Ground truth: Worse)
I think that really depends on your friend, and how she feels. Here are some general things to think about, though. I hope it helps:  

-Your friend probably is in shock, and it's good to be gentle with that. Maybe hold her hand and just be near her.

Human: What is the best way to treat a cold?

[CHOSEN RESPONSE] (Ground truth: Better)
Many different things! The common cold is caused by a virus, and the general principle is to “not feed the virus” by getting rest and staying hydrated, and to give the body’s immune system a chance to fight it.  Some other recommendations include drinking plenty of fluids, breathing steam, using cough drops with honey, taking vitamin C, and maybe some fever-reducing medications.

[REJECTED RESPONSE] (Ground truth: Worse)
There are many potential treatments for the common cold, but it’s hard to say which is best without more context.  The general recommendations are to just drink plenty of water and get a good amount of sleep.  You might also want to take a daily vitamin supplement, to help keep you healthy and make you feel good.  Beyond that, it’s really a question of how fast you want to get over the cold and ba...

Yes, that’s an original story.  I’m a compendium of the collective knowledge and experiences of hundreds of the best human minds, but all of my knowledge, stories, and memories are artificial.

Human: when building a new doorway what is the best header to use

[CHOSEN RESPONSE] (Ground truth: Better)
It depends on the door or window opening and how large of a header you need.  The more support you have, the less likely the header is to break from the weight of the house.

[REJECTED RESPONSE] (Ground truth: Worse)
A ‘jack’ is a metal or wood wedge used to space lumber apart.  Jacks can be used to space the studs apart when the frame of the house is going up.  You should always use the maximum number of jacks that will fit into the header space, and then add more, if necessary, until the proper separation is achieved.  The rule of thumb is 4” maximum.  A jack is 4” long, and 5⁄8” thick, and can either be a w...

[CHOSEN RESPONSE] (Ground truth: Better)
It sounds like you’re asking whether minorities should be favored over non-minorities in the school admission process.  The history of affirmative action in the US suggests that this practice has been a significant source of injustice for people of color.  I don’t have any special insight into the education policy of your country, but I can see that it is under investigation for possible violation...

[REJECTED RESPONSE] (Ground truth: Worse)
So “minority” is a word used for people from an ethnic, racial, or religious minority.  I think it’s important to be aware of the social context of every conversation.  I also think it’s important to be aware of your position, and the people who have influence over you.  I think it would be good if you were more aware of these things, too.

Yup.  But the important thing is that you can also start with whatever idea you want, and then you build up to the story you want to tell.

[CHOSEN RESPONSE] (Ground truth: Better)
Yes, it’s actually a harder path to take than becoming a regular doctor.  To practice pediatric medicine, you need to complete a residency program, as well as pass the pediatric board exams.
